# Donation campaign
### Project features of this Project

* I created three Route used this project. one is Home Route, then Dontaion Route and last one is Statistic Route.
  
* First of all Home Route created for displaying nabvar,banner,and all card section.

* All donation data (whice is getting form json file) disply in all card section of the Home page.
  
* When user click in 'donation card' of the all card display section.then redirect to the another dynamic Route where he can see the details information of this card.
  
* In this dynamic Route has a price button.If User click in button,then added this your donation in localstorage.
  
* After save this data in localstorage,then user can see the his/her donation in the donation Route.

* When User give donation then show succesfull meassage by toast.but alredy given donation then will be false message by toast. example('donation already added. sorry!')
  
* In Statistic Route, I display percentage of total dontaion and user donation in Pie chart.exmaple total donation 200 and user donation 20. then will be  percantage calculate automitically.because this formula already definied in pie chart.
  
* If user want to category name by search, then he can will do.
